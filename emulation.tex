\chapter{Emulation Systems}

Emulation is the process of duplicating the outwardly observable behavior of an existing system.
Emulation does not necessarily model the underlying state of the target.
Simulation, on the other hand, involves modeling the underlying state of the target.
The end result of a correct simulation is that simulation emulates the target system exactly.
A representation used in simulation is traditionally referred to as a simulacrum: a representation of the system without the substance or qualities of the original, for example, a historical reenactment.
