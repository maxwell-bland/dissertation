\begin{abstract}
The world is full of problems for which weak assumptions will not suffice to provide security, as adversaries are more than willing to make axiomatic leaps if these are counterbalanced by opportunity cost.
However, standard analyses of systems' security tend to avoid strong speculations due to concerns over the precision of the resulting derivation.
For example, fuzzing speculates on potential inputs to a process but not the process itself.
The question that interests us is therefore \emph{what defines a threat surface} and whether we can develop exploits from partial, residual, or correlated information domains.

Put more precisely, will stronger speculations regarding a system allow us to develop novel exploits and what does such speculation entail?
After all, in the presence of empirical falsifiability axiomatic strength is irrelevant, so we may defend the utility of this approach by applying it to material: we achieve code execution on a critical aircraft component, determine redacted text using leaked information, and model inputs necessary for the precise destabilization of a chemical plant's reactor pressure.

We explore the effects of this strategy by analyzing how \emph{cartesian doubt} manifests in well-defined systems, such as a software's PDF document output, firmware meant to run on a physical system, and mathematics.
In avionics we discover it is not necessary to model some hardware or software semantics of a system to develop exploits.
We also find the exact resolution of a redaction's content is often not necessary to severely threaten its security.
Last, in our analysis of continuous control equations, we demonstrate imprecise representations of a program's semantics can be used to develop precise exploits on a system.
